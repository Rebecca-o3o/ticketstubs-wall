### Wall
When firstly viewing the wall, users see an empty example ticket. With a click on the add icon or via the hamburger menu, users can upload their own tickets and adding event details (name, venue, date, time). The uploaded image will be displayed immediately.
Uploaded tickets have an option to edit event details or delete tickets.
Each ticket can be dragged around on the wall.
